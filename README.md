# Personal_bot
A small project, consisting of several small projects. Very limited in what it can do, but very nice and contains several games.

The personal bot has a main window, you can run it through: Ezra/bin/debug/net7.0-windows/Ezra.exe.
The options are:
Play 2 games: catch the ghost, in the style of an Israeli TV show from the 2000s; Guess the character with a limited number of yes/no questions.
Activate an alarm clock that checks input integrity and plays a song.
Playing songs from YouTube.
and basic chat.
